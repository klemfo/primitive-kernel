================

Only a learning project.

I will firstly add memory probing (according to this tutorial: http://wiki.osdev.org/Detecting_Memory_(x86))
and boot memory initialisation (something like https://www.kernel.org/doc/gorman/html/understand/understand008.html). I hope I will be able to test it through this procedure: http://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones
